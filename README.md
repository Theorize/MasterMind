# MasterMind
An implementation of Knuth’s algorithm to solve Mastermind, the board game. Here, the user plays as the Code-Maker, and the computer ‘guesses’ their code. In order to use the program, you should understand how to play as a Code-Maker. The role includes creating a code consisting of a sequence of coloured balls. The computer tries to figure out your code by making guesses, which you then score. The score consists of two components. The first is an integer representing the number of coloured balls that are in exactly the right place. The second is an integer represented how many balls have the correct colour, but are located in the wrong place in the code. Further details can be found here: http://www.wikihow.com/Play-Mastermind.

Note: This code was orginally written as part of a successful application to the Recurse Center.
